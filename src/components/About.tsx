        Hey there! I’m Rajsv Mahendra — a third-year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering
        student at Lovely Professional University, and someone who refuses to just sit 
        and wait for life to happen. I’m not just a student; 
        I’m a builder, a learner, and a doer. 
        I’m currently open to job opportunities, collaborations, 
        and freelance gigs that challenge me, grow me, 
        and let me put my skills to real use.
        </p>
